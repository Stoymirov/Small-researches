    "The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. It’s based on the idea that, even though an eavesdropper can see the exchange of data, they cannot compute the shared secret without **solving a difficult mathematical problem** (discrete logarithm problem).\n",
