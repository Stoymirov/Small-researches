    "EKG stands for electrocardiogram. It is used to test the electrical activity of the heart and detect problems. Some things it does are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Records how fast your heart is beating\n",
    " - Shows whether the rhythm is steady or irregular\n",
    " - Detects signs of heart disease, heart attacks, or abnormal heart function\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to give a more mathematical definition it would be that it is a **1D time-series** recording the electrical activity of the heart over time, measured in **millivolts(mV)**\n",

In a healthy heart, this segment is usually flat (isoelectric). Abnormal elevation or depression of this segment may indicate injury, inflammation, or stress to the heart or other systems.\n",

    "- **Pericarditis:**  causes widespread concave (“saddleback”) ST segment elevation with PR segment depression in multiple leads, typically involving I, II, III, aVF, aVL, and V2-6.\n",
    "- **Benign Early Repolarization:** There is slight concave ST elevation in the precordial and inferior leads with notching of the J-point (the “fish-hook” pattern)\n",
    "- **Raised Intracranial Pressure:** Widespread ST elevation with concave (pericarditis-like) morphology in a patient with severe traumatic brain injury.\n",
