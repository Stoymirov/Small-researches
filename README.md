# Small-researches

This repository is a collection of small research projects, code experiments, and exploratory notebooks created out of curiosity and a desire to understand technical and mathematical concepts more deeply.

Each subfolder contains a self-contained topic where I’ve either implemented a concept, visualized data, or tried to explain something interesting—from cryptography basics and analytics to early steps into machine learning.

###  Why this repo?

As someone passionate about both programming and theoretical understanding, I often take the time to break down and explore topics that I find intriguing. This repository is my personal lab—where ideas are tested, small insights are documented, and deeper understanding is built through hands-on experimentation.

###  Topics Covered (so far)

- Exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks
- Introductory machine learning concepts explained with code
- Notes and code on cryptographic ideas
- Experiments with dimensionality reduction and visualization

### ⚙ Tools & Languages Used

- Python (Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Markdown for documentation
- Ideas associated with artificial intelligence

> I plan to continue expanding this folder as I work through new ideas and questions. Suggestions or discussions are always welcome!
