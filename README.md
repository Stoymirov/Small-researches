# Small-researches
# Small Researches 🧠📊

This repository is a collection of small research projects, code experiments, and exploratory notebooks created out of curiosity and a desire to understand technical and mathematical concepts more deeply.

Each subfolder contains a self-contained topic where I’ve either implemented a concept, visualized data, or tried to explain something interesting—from cryptography basics and analytics to early steps into machine learning.

### 🔍 Why this repo?

As someone passionate about both programming and theoretical understanding, I often take the time to break down and explore topics that I find intriguing. This repository is my personal lab—where ideas are tested, small insights are documented, and deeper understanding is built through hands-on experimentation.

### 🧩 Topics Covered (so far)

- C# and algorithm implementations
- Exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks
- Introductory machine learning concepts explained with code
- Notes and code on cryptographic ideas
- Experiments with dimensionality reduction and visualization

### ⚙️ Tools & Languages Used

- Python (Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- C# (.NET)
- Markdown for documentation
